Thank you for using my application. This is a fine tuned version of Open AI which is being leveraged to use for RPGs. It will assist game leaders to generate unique and creative responses for their players using details from their world. Here are the steps and details needed to fully utilize the application.

1. A destription of your world. For example, countries, political landscape, special rules, as much detail as you can feed it. The AI will store and remember these details in future conversations.
2. Key Characters and descriptions. These characters will be called upon frequently or possibly be part of the main story. The bot will use these players or roleplay as these characters if they are ever brought into conversation. Include details like backstory, quirks, and mannerisms to build a good personality.
3. A setup for each situation. Each mission will have its own objectives or setting. Be sure to let OpenAI know what you are doing, what the goal is, or how it should be acting.

Thats it! For now.
